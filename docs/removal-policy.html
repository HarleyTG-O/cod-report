        <h2>üìú Cheater Report Removal Policy</h2>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> March 10, 2025</p>
        <p><strong>Applies To:</strong> All users submitting a Cheater Removal Request / Appeal Form via website or Discord</p>

        <h3>1. Purpose of This Policy:</h3>
        <p>This policy outlines the rules, guidelines, and terms regarding removal or dispute of cheater reports submitted to our system. It ensures fair treatment for users while protecting the integrity of our anti-cheat reporting system.</p>

        <h3>2. Eligibility for Removal Requests:</h3>
        <p>You may submit a removal/appeal request if:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You believe the report against you was false or mistaken.</li>
          <li>Your behavior or circumstances have changed (e.g., past report is outdated).</li>
          <li>You were mistakenly identified or reported under the wrong Activision ID.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Review Process:</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Standard Review:</strong> Free, processed within 3‚Äì7 business days.<br>
          <strong>Fast-Track Review:</strong> Paid option for quicker response (12‚Äì24 hours or 6 hours depending on tier).<br>
          <strong>Priority Cases:</strong> May be escalated at our discretion (e.g., for critical errors or duplicate reports).
        </p>
        <p>All appeals are manually reviewed. Submitting false or misleading appeals may result in penalties or blacklisting from future submissions.</p>

        <h3>4. Supporting Evidence:</h3>
        <p>You are encouraged to provide supporting evidence (e.g., gameplay footage, screenshots, context). Strong evidence significantly increases the chance of successful appeal.</p>

        <h3>5. Payment Terms (For Fast-Track Services):</h3>
        <p>If you choose a paid appeal service:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Payment is required before the fast-track review begins.</li>
          <li>Payment does not guarantee removal ‚Äî only priority in review processing.</li>
          <li>No refunds are issued if your request is denied, unless processing fails due to our error.</li>
          <li>All payments must be made through approved methods: PayPal, Stripe, Ko-fi, Crypto, or Discord Nitro Gifts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6. ‚ÄúClear My Name‚Äù & Subscription Services:</h3>
        <p>For users seeking full history audits or subscription-based support:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Services cover up to 3 historical reports per audit.</li>
          <li>Monthly subscriptions include 1 free removal request per cycle and priority customer support.</li>
          <li>Subscriptions can be canceled at any time via your account or contact support.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>7. Abuse & Blacklist Policy:</h3>
        <p>We reserve the right to deny requests or blacklist users who:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Submit fake removal requests.</li>
          <li>Attempt to manipulate the reporting system.</li>
          <li>Abuse fast-track services for false appeals.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>8. Data Privacy & Confidentiality:</h3>
        <p>All submissions are reviewed privately. Your information and evidence will not be shared publicly. Only authorized staff will handle your appeal.</p>

        <h3>9. Dispute Resolution:</h3>
        <p>If you believe your appeal was unfairly denied, you may request a final review or escalation via our Discord support team. Final decisions are at the discretion of the review team.</p>

        <h3>10. Policy Updates:</h3>
        <p>This policy is subject to updates at any time. All users will be bound by the most recent version upon submission of a request.</p>
